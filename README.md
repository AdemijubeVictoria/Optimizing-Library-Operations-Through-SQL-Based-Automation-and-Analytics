- Member with id C1297 has highest number of days overdue (706 days) and is to pay a fine of $353.0
- This shows whether an issued book has been returned and the condition of returned books.
- “Monitored Human Resource Definition” is currently unavailable while “Implemented Fresh Thinking Architecture is available”.
- Branch 001 issued the highest number of books and generated the largest revenue.
- Presently, here are 13 members who have borrowed at least a book in the last 60 days.
- Employees E127 and E117 issued the highest number of books, 18 and 17 respectively.
- They both work in branch B005.
- There was no member who returned damaged books more than once.
